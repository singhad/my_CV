- **Abstract:** ```Internet of Things (IoT) applications combined with edge analytics are increasingly developed and deployed across a wide range of industries by engineers who are non-expert software developers. In order to enable them to build such IoT applications, we apply low-code technologies in this case study based on Model Driven Development. We use two different frameworks: DIME for the application design and implementation of IoT and edge aspects as well as analytics in R, and Pyrus for data analytics in Python, demonstrating how such engineers can build innovative IoT applications without having the full coding expertise. With this approach, we develop an application that connects a range of heterogeneous technologies: sensors through the EdgeX middleware platform with data analytics and web based configuration applications. The connection to data analytics pipelines can provide various kinds of information to the application users. Our innovative development approach has the potential to simplify the development and deployment of such applications in industry.```

## Model-driven engineering in digital thread platforms: a practical use case and future challenges

- **Citation:** Chaudhary, H.A.A. et al. (2022). *Model-Driven Engineering in Digital Thread Platforms: A Practical Use Case and Future Challenges*. ISoLA 2022. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 13704. Springer, Cham.
- **Abstract:** ```The increasing complexity delivered by the heterogeneity of the cyber-physical systems is being addressed and decoded by edge technologies, IoT development, robotics, digital twin engineering, and AI. Nevertheless, tackling the orchestration of these complex ecosystems has become a challenging problem. Specially the inherent entanglement of the different emerging technologies makes it hard to maintain and scale such ecosystems. In this context, the usage of model-driven engineering as a more abstract form of glue-code, replacing the boilerplate fashion, has improved the software development lifecycle, democratising the access to and use of the aforementioned technologies. In this paper, we present a practical use case in the context of Smart Manufacturing, where we use several platforms as providers of a high-level abstraction layer, as well as security measures, allowing a more efficient system construction and interoperability.```

## Efficient Model-Driven Prototyping for Edge Analytics
- **Publication:** MDPI Electronics 2023 (Journal)
- **Date Published:** 14.09.2023
- **URL:** [Read More](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/18/3881)
- **Citation:** Chaudhary, Hafiz Ahmad Awais, Ivan Guevara, Amandeep Singh, Alexander Schieweck, Jobish John, Tiziana Margaria, and Dirk Pesch. 2023. "Efficient Model-Driven Prototyping for Edge Analytics" Electronics 12, no. 18: 3881. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics12183881.
- **Abstract:** ```Software development cycles in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications require the orchestration of different technological layers, and involve complex technical challenges. The engineering team needs to become experts in these technologies and time delays are inherent due to the cross-integration process because they face steep learning curves in several technologies, which leads to cost issues, and often to a resulting product that is prone to bugs. We propose a more straightforward approach to the construction of high-quality IoT applications by adopting model-driven technologies (DIME and Pyrus), that may be used jointly or in isolation. The presented use case connects various technologies: the application interacts through the EdgeX middleware platform with several sensors and data analytics pipelines. This web-based control application collects, processes and displays key information about the state of the edge data capture and computing that enables quick strategic decision-making. In the presented case study of a Stable Storage Facility (SSF), we use DIME to design the application for IoT connectivity and the edge aspects, MongoDB for storage and Pyrus to implement no-code data analytics in Python. We have integrated nine independent technologies in two distinct Low-code development environments with the production of seven processes and pipelines, and the definition of 25 SIBs in nine distinct DSLs. The presented case study is benchmarked with the platform to showcase the role of code generation and the reusability of components across applications. We demonstrate that the approach embraces a high level of reusability and facilitates domain engineers to create IoT applications in a low-code fashion.```

## CNN-based Human Activity Recognition on Edge Computing Devices
- **Publication:** IEEE COINS 2023 (Conference)
- **Date Published:** 23.07.2023
- **URL:** [Read More](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10189270)
- **Citation:** A. Singh, T. Margaria and F. Demrozi, "CNN-based Human Activity Recognition on Edge Computing Devices," 2023 IEEE International Conference on Omni-layer Intelligent Systems (COINS), Berlin, Germany, 2023, pp. 1-4, doi: 10.1109/COINS57856.2023.10189270.
- **Abstract:** ```Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a research area that involves wearable devices integrating inertial and/or physiological sensors to classify human actions and status across various application domains, such as healthcare, sports, industry, and entertainment. However, executing HAR algorithms on remote devices or the cloud can lead to issues such as latency, bandwidth requirements, and energy consumption. Transitioning towards Edge HAR can be a more effective and versatile solution, overcoming the challenges of traditional HAR techniques. We present a novel HAR model for computation on edge devices: we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Deep Learning approach and compare its performance with cloud-computing HAR models. The paper is accompanied by a self-collected dataset. The experiments on this dataset demonstrate that the proposed edge computing model achieves promising results ( ≥ 92 %) in terms of Precision, Recall, and Fl-score. Furthermore, the model exhibits significantly reduced latency, with only 117 ms, and utilizes minimal memory, with a peak of 18.8 Kb RAM and 956 Kb Flash memory.```

## IDPP: Imbalanced Datasets Pipelines in Pyrus
- **Publication:** ECBS 2023 (Conference)
- **Date Published:** 16.10.2023
- **URL:** [Read More](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49252-5_6)
- **Citation:** Singh, Amandeep, and Olga Minguett. "IDPP: Imbalanced Datasets Pipelines in Pyrus." International Conference on Engineering of Computer-Based Systems. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2023.
- **Abstract:** ```We showcase and demonstrate IDPP, a Pyrus-based tool that offers a collection of pipelines for the analysis of imbalanced datasets. Like Pyrus, IDPP is a web-based, low-code/no-code graphical modelling environment for ML and data analytics applications. On a case study from the medical domain, we solve the challenge of re-using AI/ML models that do not address data with imbalanced class by implementing ML algorithms in Python that do the re-balancing. We then use these algorithms and the original ML models in the IDPP pipelines. With IDPP, our low-code development approach to balance datasets for AI/ML applications can be used by non-coders. It simplifies the data-preprocessing stage of any AI/ML project pipeline, which can potentially improve the performance of the models. The tool demo will showcase the low-code implementation and no-code reuse and repurposing of AI-based systems through end-to end Pyrus pipelines.```

- **Citation:** Singh, Amandeep, Olga Minguett, and Tiziana Margaria. "Binary Decision Diagrams and Composite Classifiers for Analysis of Imbalanced Medical Datasets." Electronic Communications of the EASST 82 (2023).
- **Abstract:** ```Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges in the development of accurate and robust classification models. In this research, we propose an approach that uses Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to conduct pre-checks and suggest appropriate resampling techniques for imbalanced medical datasets as the application domain where we apply this technology is medical data collections. BDDs provide an efficient representation of the decision boundaries, enabling interpretability and providing valuable insights. In our experiments, we evaluate the proposed approach on various real-world imbalanced medical datasets, including Cerebralstroke dataset, Diabetes dataset and Sepsis dataset. Overall, our research contributes to the field of imbalanced medical dataset analysis by presenting a novel approach that uses BDDs and composite classifiers in a low-code/no-code environment. The results highlight the potential for our method to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes in imbalanced medical datasets.```
